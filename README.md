**Network Topology Template** is an Libre Office document with symbols. Combined with a design technique and a set of rules you can draw complex computers networks. All you need is copy/paste symbols in a new document and arrange them into a topology. Also you can add on the plan more details like ip's,connections,sockets,buildings and many more. You can draw complex topologies on multiple pages and you can add even a cartridge with designer details for professional drawings. An example are on the second page.
