All you need is copy/paste symbols in a new document and arrange them into a topology. Also you can add on the plan more details like ip's,connections,sockets,buildings and many more. 

You can draw complex topologies on multiple pages and you can add even a cartridge with designer details for professional drawings. An example are on the second page.

Notice that some symbols are composite and may contain more simple symbols grouped. Double click on a composite and copy/paste component symbols to your design. An example of composite symbol is the router.

* from symbols file copy/paste frame
* copy/paste cartridge
* copy as you need various simbols and arrange them into your design
* use connectors to link dynamically the simbols
* follow the example guideline

**Tips**
* look at the name of every symbol to see what it mean
* the `` brick `` object is for design new symbols not for use in current drawings
