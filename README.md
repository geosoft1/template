**How to use**

All you need is paste symbols in a new document and arrange them into a topology. Also you can add to the plan more details like ip,connections,sockets,buildings and and whatever you consider useful for your design.

You could draw complex topologies on multiple pages and you can add a layout with designer details for professional drawings. A dummy example is in the above picture.

To start drawing create a new document in LibreOffice Draw and do the following:

* Format the page as you need (A4 or A3+ for big drawings, preferably landscape)
* Put details zone in the bootom right
* Add a surveying of the space as picture
* Copy the symbols needed and arrange them into your design
* Use connectors to link dynamically the symbols
* Follow the example guideline

**Tips**
* Look at the name of every symbol to see what it mean
* For network elements you can add links to the devices instead labels (see Ctrl+K)
